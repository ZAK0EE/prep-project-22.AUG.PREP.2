# MLH Prep Project

Over the next 2 weeks, you'll be building a React App that works with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that talk to different data sources to do cool stuff.

We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. Your challenge over the next 2 weeks is to build out this website and add even more functionality to it. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out [Issues](/issues) for some more ideas!

You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the [website](https://reactjs.org) for some information on getting started!

## Installation & Development

### 1- Prerequisites
To run a react project, you need to have the following prerequisite:
- [Node.js & NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> To test if node is installed, run `node -v` in your terminal.

> To test if npm is installed, run `npm -v` in your terminal.
### 2- Install

First you'll need to install the dependencies of the project.
- Run `npm install` in your terminal in the root of the project.

### 3- Development

Then you'll need to start the development server. This will open a new tab in your browser and reload when you make a change.
- Run `npm start` in your terminal in the root of the project.

### 4- Deployment

To build the project for production, run `npm run build`.

More documentation on the scripts can be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts).
